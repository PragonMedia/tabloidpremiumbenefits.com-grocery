    <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with unaffiliated third parties, except when you give us permission or under the following specific circumstances:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>We share information with trusted partners who work with us under confidentiality agreements. These partners may use your information to help us communicate about offers and services, but they cannot independently share this information.</li>
        <li>We respond to legal requests such as subpoenas, court orders, or legal processes, or when establishing or defending our legal rights.</li>
        <li>We share information when necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, threats to safety, violations of our terms, or as required by law.</li>
        <li>We transfer information if our company is acquired or merged with another company. In such cases, we will notify you before your information is transferred to a new privacy policy.</li>
        <li>We share your information with vendors, suppliers, and advertisers who want to do business with you. While we verify these parties promote relevant products and services, we cannot endorse them unless we explicitly state otherwise.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you prefer not to have your information shared in this manner, please see the opt-out information below. Note that we will retain your information as necessary to maintain our relationship with you, and opting out after we've already shared your information with third parties will not affect their use of that information.</p>

    <p>By using our services, you grant us and our partners the right to contact you regarding various products and services, including but not limited to motor vehicles. This includes packaging your information as sales leads and sharing it with interested parties. You authorize us to take all reasonable actions necessary to accomplish these purposes.</p>

    <h2>Communication and Marketing Laws</h2>
    <p>Your use of this website establishes a business relationship with us under CAN-SPAM, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and other applicable laws regarding commercial communications. By accessing this website, you agree that we, our agents, or parties to whom we provide your information may contact you via phone calls, including automated dialing systems, pre-recorded messages, or SMS text messages, even if your number is on a do-not-call list, regarding the promotion of goods, services, real property, or other valuable items.</p>

    <h2>Cookie Usage</h2>
    <p>We may place and access cookies on your computer to enhance your experience.</p>
    <p>Important information about our cookie usage:</p>

    <h2>Data Security and Protection</h2>
    <p>We restrict access to your personal information to employees who need it to provide services to you or perform their job functions.</p>

    <p>We implement physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information.</p>

    <p>Your data is stored on servers located in the United States.
